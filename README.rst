*Yet Another BSD Hypervisor*

ezjail, iocage, ... nice project but dead or soon to be.

I'm tired of that so this is a stupid project to do almost the same thing.

About
=====
The main objective is to build something close to what iocage does.

The second one is have as few dependencies as possible (see requirements).

Features
--------
* Re use of common subtree per release (using nullfs)
* Works with ZFS

Requirements
============
* jq
